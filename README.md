# OrcKnuckle Game

OrcKnuckle is a text-based dice game implemented in Python, inspired by a popular gambling game from the Crossfire RPG. 
This project simulates a fantasy gambling game where players roll custom dice (knuckles) and score based on the faces showing. 
OrcKnuckle is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), ensuring that it remains free and open source.

## Game Overview
OrcKnuckle is a simple yet engaging game where players roll four knucklesâ€”three 5-sided dice and one special 6-sided die 
(the thumb knuckle). The faces of the dice are carved with runes representing different characters and creatures:

    - Knuckle Faces: Beholder, Ghost, Princess, Knight, Dragon
    - Thumb Knuckle Faces: Beholder, Ghost, Princess, Knight, Dragon, Orc

## Scoring Rules

    - Beholder: 1 point
    - Princess & Knight: 2 points each
    - Dragon: 3 points
    - Ghost: Cancels out a Princess (no points)
    - Knight: Cancels out a Dragon (no points)
    - Orc: Cancels everything (0 points)

The player with the highest score after rolling wins the round. If there is a tie, the bets carry over to the next round.
